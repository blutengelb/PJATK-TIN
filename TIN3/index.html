        <h1>Mercedes Benz</h1>
        <p id="mercedes">
            <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/">Mercedes-Benz</a> commonly referred to as just Mercedes, is a
            German luxury automotive marque. Mercedes-Benz and subsidiary Mercedes-Benz AG – of Daimler AG – are
            headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Mercedes-Benz produces consumer luxury vehicles and
            commercial vehicles. Its first Mercedes-Benz-badged vehicles were produced in 1926. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz
            was the largest seller of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p id="history">
            Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first internal combustion engine in a car,
            seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry and patented in January 1886 –
            and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of a
            petrol engine, introduced later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by
            Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG). In 1958, the two companies began a partnership to sell their cars in the
            United States with Studebaker. A few American-based Daimler-Benz dealerships were converted into
            Mercedes-Benz dealerships when Daimler's non-Mercedes-partnered company closed in 1966.

        <h1>Motorsport</h1>
        <p id="motorsport">
            The two companies which were merged to form the Mercedes-Benz brand in 1926 had both already enjoyed success
            in the new sport of motor racing throughout their separate histories. A single Benz competed in the world's
            first motor race, the 1894 Paris–Rouen, where Émile Roger finished 14th in 10 hours 1 minute. Throughout its
            long history, the company has been involved in a range of motorsport activities, including sports car racing
            and rallying. On several occasions, Mercedes-Benz has withdrawn completely from motorsport for a significant
            period, notably in the late 1930s, and after the 1955 Le Mans disaster, where a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR rammed
            another car (an Austin-Healey), took off into the stands, and killed more than 80 spectators. Stirling Moss
            and co-driver Denis Jenkinson won the 1955 Mille Miglia road race in Italy during a record-breaking drive
            with an average speed of almost 98 mph in a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR.
        </p>
        <h1>Formula One</h1>
        <p id="formula">Mercedes-Benz took part in the world championship in 1954 and 1955, but despite being successful
            with two
            championship titles for Juan-Manuel Fangio, the company left the sport after just two seasons.
            Mercedes-Benz returned as an engine manufacturer in 1994, with the engines being designed and manufactured
            by Ilmor in Brixworth. It initially partnered with Sauber, before switching to McLaren in 1995. Although
            the Mercedes engines were not successful at first, they later won drivers' championships for Mika Häkkinen
            in 1998 and 1999, and for Lewis Hamilton in 2008, as well as a constructors' championship in 1998. Mercedes
            part-owned McLaren, and the collaboration had been extended into the production of road-going cars such as
            the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren.
            In 2007, McLaren-Mercedes was fined a record US$100 million for stealing confidential Ferrari technical data

        <h1>Mercedes-AMG</h1>
        <p>Mercedes-AMG became a majority owned division of Mercedes-Benz in 1999. The company was integrated into
            DaimlerChrysler in 1999, and became Mercedes-Benz AMG on 1 January 1999</p>
        <h1>Mercedes-Maybach</h1>
        <p>Daimler's ultra-luxury Maybach brand was under the Mercedes-Benz Cars division until December 2012, when
            production was stopped due to decreased sales. It now exists under the Mercedes-Maybach name, with the
            models being luxury-focused enhanced models of Mercedes-Benz cars, such as the 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600.
            The Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 SUV debuted in November 2019.</p>
